# Golem application initialized!

Welcome to Golem.

## Getting Started

The application is generated, but doesn't do much by default. To start getting things
running, you'll need to enable some plugins. You can enable a plugin with a command like:

> golem plugin enable [plugin]

## Run the following to start your application:

> cd [dir] && go run .

For more information, check out the README.md file in your new application.
