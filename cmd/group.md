# Group added!

## Remember to run `golem generate` to update the generated code.

Groups don't do anything by themselves, they just collect routes together. You will need
to add a `route` to this group to use it. Try the following:

> golem add route [group] [route]

Get more information about the options for this command with:

> golem add route --help
